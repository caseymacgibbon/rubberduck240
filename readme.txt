Readme: To explain the game play, create a readme.txt file with instructions for me. Clearly explain the goal of the game and how I should use the keyboard/mouse to play it. If you used a particular web browser to run your program, let me know that too. I will not debug your code - make sure everything is included so that it will work out of the box. If I have to guess, you may not get the credit you deserve.

The game play is as follows:
- Click inside the window
- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the duck around
- If the duck is hit by a bubble, the game is over
- The goal of the game is to last as long as possible without being hit by a bubble
- The bubbles get faster as game time increases, making it harder to avoid
- You will get a point every time you avoid a sequence of bubbles
- The object is to gain as many points as possible
