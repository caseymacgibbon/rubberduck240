The game play is as follows:
- Click inside the window
- Use WASD or the arrow keys to move the duck around
- If the duck is hit by a bubble, the game is over
- The goal of the game is to last as long as possible without being hit by a bubble
- The bubbles get faster as game time increases, making it harder to avoid
- You will get a point every time you avoid a sequence of bubbles
- The object is to gain as many points as possible
